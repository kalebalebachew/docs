##### This guide will walk you through the usage of **Replay-API**, covering how to apply the middleware, configure retry limits, and replay failed requests.

## Applying the Middleware

### Global Middleware Application

You can apply the **Replay-API** middleware globally across all routes in your Express application. This ensures that every incoming request will be tracked for potential failure and retry.

```js
import { requestReplayMiddleware } from 'replay-api';

app.use(requestReplayMiddleware);

```

### Route specific Middleware Application

If you want more control and only wish to apply the middleware to specific routes, you can do so by applying it to the individual route handlers.

```js
app.post('/api/test-endpoint', requestReplayMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Your route logic here
});

```
## Configuring Retry Limits

```js
import { replayFailedRequests } from 'replay-api';

replayFailedRequests({ retryLimit: 5 });

```
## Replaying Failed Requests
Once failed requests have been captured, you can replay them using the Replay-APIâ€™s **replayFailedRequests** function. This function will automatically handle the retry logic for you.

```js
import { replayFailedRequests } from 'replay-api';

replayFailedRequests();

```
## Customizing Replay Options

```js
replayFailedRequests({
  retryLimit: 3,
  retryInterval: 2000, // in milliseconds
  onRetry: (request) => console.log(`Retrying request: ${request.url}`)
});

```
